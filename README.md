# What is programming?

## A warm-up presentation for people who know nothing about programming ##
 
This presentation is targeted to people who have no experience on programming and it's very simplistic. 10 minutes warm-up presentation is much better than 60 minutes technical presentation which gives listeners an information overload.

These slides were made with [Keydown](https://github.com/infews/keydown).

### Generate 'slides.html' from 'slides.md' ###

First you need to install keydown, then you can generate slides.html file by typing:

    keydown slides slides.md
